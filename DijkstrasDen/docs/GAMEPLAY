|  Dijkstra's Den  |
+------------------+

Welcome to Dijkstra's Den! 

You are NodeMan a peculiar character stuck  on the orthogonal world 
that is Dijkstra's Den.

The Den consists of a series of levels. In each level, a grid of nodes 
is laid out a 2-dimensional plane. You start on a fixed node, and 
your goal is to get to the other end of the plane where there's a 
special exit node waiting for you.

Wait! It's not that simple. There are no roads in Dijkstra's Den, 
just nodes and links between nodes. All these links are perpendicular,
meaning you have to turn 90 degrees to get from one to the other.

Your goal is to run across these links and nodes as fast as possible and 
get to the exit node.

Finish all the levels and you can escape from Dijkstra's Den!


Controls:
--------

Once the game starts you start at one node, and you are placed there 
facing the next node. Hold your phone sideways (i.d. landscape mode)

*Touch - Press anywhere on the touchscreen to walk in the direction that 
          you are facing. The character will walk till it hits the next node
          and stop

*Move  - Continue to hold the phone sideways and twist 90 degrees in any 
          direction to face in the new direction. 
       
*New level - Complete a level and press anywhere on the touchscreen to load 
              the next level.
       
Feedback:
--------
* Node hit  - A short vibration and a "pop"
* Walking   - Footsteps
* Turning   - Two short vibrations and a "swish"
* Level 
   complete - Three short vibrations followed by a long vibration and a chime
